## 📌 Task 1: Predict Taxi Fare (City of Chicago Dataset)

**Objective**:  
Train a regression model to predict the **fare** of a taxi ride using trip data from the City of Chicago.

**Steps included**:
- Data loading and preprocessing
- Feature engineering (hour of day, weekday, trip time, miles)
- Linear regression model training
- Evaluation using RMSE and R²
- Visualizing actual vs predicted fares

## 📌 Task 2: Predict Body Weight from Height, Age, and Gender

**Objective**:  
Use linear regression to predict a person’s **body weight** based on:
- Height  
- Age  
- Gender (encoded numerically)

**Dataset**: A small custom dataset of 10 rows.

**Steps included**:
- Data setup and encoding
- Model fitting and coefficient interpretation
- Predictions and performance check
